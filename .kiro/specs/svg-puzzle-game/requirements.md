# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for an SVG-based abstract puzzle game built for Reddit Devvit. The game presents players with scattered SVG puzzle pieces that must be rotated and aligned to reconstruct beautiful abstract geometric figures. The game features progressive difficulty, custom cartoony UI components, sound effects, and integration with Reddit's social features including leaderboards and user profiles.

## Glossary

- **Game System**: The SVG-based puzzle game application running within Reddit Devvit
- **Puzzle Piece**: An individual SVG element that can be rotated by the player
- **Abstract Figure**: The complete geometric pattern formed when all puzzle pieces are correctly aligned
- **Level**: A single puzzle challenge with a specific number of pieces and rotation increment
- **Rotation Increment**: The angle by which a puzzle piece rotates with each click (e.g., 90°, 45°, 30°)
- **Component Library**: The custom-built UI component system with cartoony styling
- **Devvit Platform**: Reddit's application platform for building interactive experiences
- **Leaderboard**: A ranked list of players based on puzzle completion metrics
- **Sound System**: The audio management system for effects and background music
- **Progress Data**: Player statistics and completion history stored persistently
